          In computer networking, host means a “server”. Just like you can put a website on the
          internet by hosting it on a server, you can make your own computer that server. This
          connection is called loopback. The IP address for that loopback is 127.0.0.1. If you’ve
          put a website on the internet before, then you’ve dealt with hosting companies like
          Heroku, Hostinger, Netlify, and many others. These are what I refer to as “remote hosts”
          or virtual servers. If you’ve served a website on your computer so you can test it without
          connecting to the internet, what you’re dealing with is a localhost. So, by definition,
          localhost is the computer or hostname currently making a request to itself. In this case,
          the computer is also the virtual server.
